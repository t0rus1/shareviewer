    <h2>Overview</h2>
    The Overview presents a table with one entry per share. Each entry's contents is taken from the last time band of each share's All-Table, 
    and therefore is also dependant on the values pertaining for the calculation parameters at the time they we generated.

    <h3>Options available</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Compile the Overview straight. Top right button</li>
        <li>Recalculate the overview. Also top right button, but this will only happen if you've changed any parameter settings at the top.</li>
        <li>You can at <i>any stage</i> do a <b>Quick Save</b>, which will save the state of the  Overview table at that moment. 
        The overview is saved in the All-Tables folder under the name <b>overview.at</b> and can at any stage be recalled using the <i>Quick-reload</i></li>
        <li>You can at any stage also save an Overview as a <b>named Overview</b>, with notes, and later reload to continue working with it</li>
        <li>Since there are many columns in the table, you are allowed to select which columns you want to see. A particular set of columns is known as a <b><i>View</i></b></li>.
        <li>You may name and save such view arrangements for later recall. It makes sense to name the views based on the calculation or topic you are focussing on.</li>
        <li>You may open up any share's All-Table by <b>double clicking in the left hand column</b></li>
        <li>You may select one or individual rows (Ctrl-Click) for either deletion or saving. Saves may be named, and have notes.</li>
        <li>There is a Save|Load drop-down button for this aforementioned purpose.</li>
        <li>If you Right-Click in the left hand column, ShareViewer will show you the date of the last day of that All-Table. 
        This is useful for confirming you are seeing what you expect to see.</li>
