    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Overview presents a table with one entry per share. Each entry's contents is taken from the last time band of each share's All-Table,
        and therefore is also dependant on the values pertaining for the calculation parameters at the time they we generated.
    </p>
    <h3>Options available</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Compile</b> the Overview straight. Top right button</li>
            <li><b>Recalculate</b> the overview. Also top right button, but this will only happen if you've changed any parameter settings at the top.</li>
            <li>
                You can at <i>any stage</i> do a <b>Quick Save</b>, which will save the state of the  Overview table at that moment.
                The overview is saved in the All-Tables folder under the name <b>overview.at</b> and can at any stage be recalled using the <i>Quick-reload</i>
            </li>
            <li>You can at any stage also save an Overview as a <b>named Overview</b>, with notes, and later reload to continue working with it</li>
            <li>Since there are many columns in the table, you are allowed to select which columns you want to see. A particular <b>set of columns</b> is known as a <b><i>View</i></b></li>.
            <li>You may name and save such view arrangements for later recall. It makes sense to name the views <b>based on the calculation or topic</b> you are focussing on.</li>
            <li>You may open up any share's <b>All-Table</b> by <b>double clicking in the left hand column</b></li>
            <li>You may <b>select</b> one or individual rows (<b>Ctrl-Click</b>) for either deletion or saving. Saves may be named, and have <b>notes</b>.</li>
            <li>There is a Save|Load drop-down button for this aforementioned purpose.</li>
            <li>
                If you Right-Click in the left hand column, ShareViewer will show you the date of the last day of that All-Table.
                This is useful for confirming you are seeing what you expect to see.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>How to Sort</h3>
    <p>
        The Overview allows for single column sorting. Simply click on a columns header to switch between ascending and descending order.
    </p>
    <h3>How to filter</h3>
    <p>
        Right Click on a column header if you wish to apply a filter criterion to a column. <br />
        A Filters box will pop up, with a filter condition row appended.
        Click in the <b><u>Compare</u></b> column to set a <b>Greater Than</b> or <b>Less Than</b> condition. 
        <br/>
        <b>Note</b>: in order to switch between these two conditions, just click again.
        <br/>Click in the <b><u>Value</u></b> column to set a threshold value.
        Enable or disable the condition using the <b><u>Apply</u></b> check-box.
        <br/><b>Add additional filter conditions</b> for other columns by continuing to right click the relevant column headers, as described above...
        <br/>Lastly, click the Apply button at the bottom. The Overview table should refresh, showing only those shares which meet your conditions.
    </p>
